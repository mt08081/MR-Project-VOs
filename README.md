# Mobile Robotics Project: Reactive Navigation via Hybrid Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (HRVO)

**Course:** Mobile Robotics (MR)  
**Status:** Phase 1-3 Complete (VO/RVO/HRVO) | Phase 4 (Multi-Agent & Global Planning) In Progress  
**Language:** MATLAB (Simulation)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the transition from static path planning to dynamic, reactive navigation in multi-agent environments. While traditional algorithms like A* or Dijkstra provide optimal paths in immutable environments, they fail in chaotic environments where obstacles (pedestrians, other robots) are in constant motion.

Our objective is to implement and simulate **Velocity Obstacles (VO)** and its advanced variants, **Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO)** and **Hybrid Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (HRVO)**. These algorithms shift the planning perspective from the Cartesian configuration space ($x, y$) to the **velocity space** ($v_x, v_y$), allowing agents to anticipate collisions before they happen.

**Architectural Pivot:** Following recent advisement, we have moved away from a ROS/Gazebo visualization bridge. Instead, we are focusing on a **Layered Planning Architecture**, demonstrating how our reactive planners (Local Layer) can be integrated with established global path planners (Global Layer) to navigate large, complex maps.

    Edit the configuration section at the top of the file:
    ```matlab
    % Algorithm Selector
    % 1 = VO (Ready), 2 = RVO (Planned), 3 = HRVO (Planned)
    ALGORITHM = 1;

      * Video recordings are automatically saved to the `output/` folder.

## 🧠 Architectural Highlights

### 1\. "Hot-Swappable" Brains

We avoid hardcoding navigation logic into the robot. Instead, `main_simulation.m` acts as the game engine. It passes the current state to a specific planner function (e.g., `plan_VO`), which returns an optimal velocity vector ($v_{opt}$). This allows us to test VO, RVO, and HRVO side-by-side on identical scenarios.

### 2\. Differential Drive Controller

The planners output a **holonomic** velocity vector ($v_x, v_y$). Since our robot works on a Unicycle Model (non-holonomic), we implement a low-level P-controller in `classes/Robot.m` to track this vector:

  * **Target Heading:** $\theta_{target} = \text{atan2}(v_y, v_x)$
  * **Angular Velocity:** $\omega = K_p \times \text{angdiff}(\theta_{current}, \theta_{target})$
  * **Linear Velocity:** $v = \|v_{opt}\| \times \cos(\text{error})$.

### 3\. Layered Planning (New\!)

Instead of relying solely on reactive logic, which can get stuck in large U-shaped traps (Local Minima), we are implementing a layered approach:

  * **Global Layer:** Calculates a high-level path (waypoints) from Start to Goal using a standard algorithm (e.g., A\*).
  * **Local Layer (VO/HRVO):** Follows the global waypoints while actively dodging dynamic obstacles in real-time.

## 📚 Theoretical Background

### Velocity Obstacles (VO) - *Implemented* [Fiorini & Shiller, 1998]

VO answers the question: *"If I choose velocity $v$, will I collide with obstacle $B$ at any future time?"*

**Mathematical Definition:**
$$VO_{A|B} = \{ v_A \mid \exists t > 0 : p_A + v_A \cdot t \in D(p_B + v_B \cdot t, r_A + r_B) \}$$

This is equivalent to translating the **Collision Cone** by $v_B$:
$$VO_{A|B} = v_B + CC_{A|B}$$

Where the cone half-angle is: $\alpha = \arcsin\left(\frac{r_A + r_B}{\|p_B - p_A\|}\right)$

**Limitation:** Assumes obstacles maintain constant velocity. Causes oscillation when two reactive agents meet (the "Mirror Effect").

### Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO) - *Implemented* [Van den Berg et al., 2008]

RVO addresses oscillation by introducing **Reciprocity** — both agents share collision avoidance responsibility.

**Mathematical Definition:**
$$RVO_{A|B} = \{ v_A \mid 2v_A - v_A^{cur} \in VO_{A|B} \}$$

Geometrically, the cone apex shifts from $v_B$ to $\frac{v_A^{cur} + v_B^{cur}}{2}$.

**Key Insight:** If both agents use RVO, they will each move halfway to avoid collision, resulting in smooth passing without oscillation.

### Hybrid Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (HRVO) - *Implemented* [Snape et al., 2011]

RVO can lead to "Reciprocal Dances" where agents are unsure whether to pass left or right. HRVO resolves this by creating an **asymmetric** forbidden region.

**Construction:** HRVO combines one leg from VO with one leg from RVO:
- **Pass Right:** Use VO's right leg + RVO's left leg
- **Pass Left:** Use VO's left leg + RVO's right leg

The passing side is determined by: $\text{cross}(p_{rel}, v_{rel}) \gtrless 0$

**Geometric Implementation (Snape et al., 2011 - Section III):**

The key insight is that the two legs originate from **different apexes**:
- VO leg originates from $v_B$ (obstacle velocity)
- RVO leg originates from $\frac{v_A + v_B}{2}$ (reciprocal apex)

These legs intersect at a **hybrid apex** $p_{\text{inter}}$, computed via ray intersection:

$$p_{\text{inter}} = \text{intersect}(\text{origin}_{\text{VO}}, \theta_{\text{VO}}, \text{origin}_{\text{RVO}}, \theta_{\text{RVO}})$$

Our implementation uses Cramer's rule to solve the 2D line intersection:
```matlab
% Solve: origin1 + t1*dir1 = origin2 + t2*dir2
det_A = dir1(1)*dir2(2) - dir1(2)*dir2(1);
t1 = (d(1)*dir2(2) - d(2)*dir2(1)) / det_A;
p_inter = origin1 + t1 * dir1;
```

This creates the correct asymmetric forbidden region that implicitly encodes a **right-hand traffic** convention, ensuring consistent passing behavior without reciprocal dance oscillations.

**Static vs Dynamic Handling:**
- **Dynamic obstacles:** Full HRVO with hybrid apex intersection
- **Static obstacles:** Fall back to standard VO (apex at $v_B = [0,0]$)

## 🔬 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Comparison

| Property | VO | RVO | HRVO |
|:---------|:---|:----|:-----|
| Apex Location | $v_B$ | $\frac{v_A + v_B}{2}$ | Intersection of VO/RVO legs |
| Cone Geometry | Symmetric | Symmetric | **Asymmetric** |
| Oscillation | ❌ Causes jitter | ✅ Eliminated | ✅ Eliminated |
| Reciprocal Dance | N/A | ❌ Can occur | ✅ Eliminated |
| Static Obstacles | Works | Falls back to VO | Falls back to VO |

### Key Implementation Choices

1. **Dynamic Threshold:** Obstacles with $\|v_{obs}\| < 0.05$ m/s are treated as static
2. **Sensor Range:** 6.0m finite time horizon for computational efficiency
3. **Safety Buffer:** 0.25m added to Minkowski sum radius for uncertainty
4. **Velocity Sampling:** Multi-resolution search with 5 speed fractions and 37 angles
5. **Emergency Escape:** Immediate reverse if already in collision configuration

## 🧪 Simulation Scenarios

We validate our algorithms against 5 distinct scenarios:

1.  **Basic:** Single robot navigating static blocks. Validates baseline avoidance.
2.  **U-Trap:** A local minimum test. VO should prevent the robot from entering the trap if the velocity vector points into it.
3.  **Hallway:** Two robots moving head-on. This is the "Gold Standard" test for RVO to demonstrate smooth passing without jitter.
4.  **Somewhat Busy:** Robot crossing paths with dynamic agents moving at constant velocities.
5.  **Very Busy Plaza:** A "stress test" with multiple crossing paths and static obstacles to ensure no deadlocks occur.
